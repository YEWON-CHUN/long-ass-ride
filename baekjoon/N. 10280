#You are training for a programming contest with your team members Alice and Bob. After some hours of hard training you want to have a break and eat pizza. 
#You decided to order a big pizza for all three of you. But you have to choose the kind of pizza you want to eat.
#You know your favorite kind. But Alice and Bob have other constraints: Alice is on a diet so she wants a pizza with less calories as possible. 
#Bob is just mean to Alice so he votes for as much calories as possible.
#You decide to vote on which kind of pizza you order. As voting for one pizza wouldnâ€™t lead anywhere, you decide to use a veto voting. 
#So everyone of you veto on pizza in a round robin manner. First Alice vetos one pizza, then Bob vetos one, at last you are allowed to veto. 
#Then Alice has the next veto again, then Bob etc. until only one pizza is left.
#Reminder: Alice will always veto the pizza with the most calories. Bob vetos always the pizza with least calories. 
#You try to be clever in such a way that your favorite pizza is the remaining pizza.
